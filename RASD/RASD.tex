\chapter{Introduction}
This document represents the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) for SafeStreets: an application that aims to improve the safety of urban areas by giving its users the possibility to report traffic violations and accidents to authorities. The goal of this document is to supply a description of the system in terms of its functional and non-functional requirements, listing all of its goals, discussing the constraints and the limits of the software, and indicating the typical use cases that will occur after the release. This document is addressed to the stakeholders, who will evaluate the correctness of the assumptions and decisions contained in it, and to the developers who will have to implement the requirements.
\section{Purpose}
SafeStreets is a crowd-sourced application that intends to provide users with the possibility to notify authorities when traffic violations and accidents occur. In order to report a traffic violation, users have to compile a report containing a picture of the violation, the date, time, position, and type of violation. SafeStreets stores all the information provided by users, completing it with suitable metadata (timestamps, sender's GPS if available, etc.). In particular, in case the user had not provided any information regarding the license plate of the car breaking the traffic rules, SafeStreets runs an algorithm to read it from the submitted picture. Moreover, the application allows both end-users and authorities to mine the information that has been received: this function allows users to perform useful statistics, for example to find out which area is more dangerous or which vehicles commit the most violations. If the municipality offers a service that allows users to retrieve the information about the accidents that occur in its territory, SafeStreets can cross this information with its own data to identify potentially unsafe areas, and suggest possible interventions.
In addition, the municipality could offer a service that takes the information about the violations coming from SafeStreets, and generates traffic tickets from it. In this case, SafeStreets ensures that the chain of custody of information coming from users is never broken, thus information is never altered. Information about issued tickets can be used by SafeStreets to build statistics, for example to have a feedback on the effectiveness of the application.

\section{Scope}
According to the \textit{World} and \textit{Machine} paradigm, proposed by M. Jackson and P. Zave in 1995, we can distinguish the \textit{Machine}, that is the portion of the system to be developed, from the \textit{World}, that is the portion of the real-world affected by the machine. In this way, we can classify the phenomena in three different types: World, Machine and \textit{Shared} phenomena, where the latter type of phenomena can be controlled by the world and observed by the machine or controlled by the machine and observed by the world.
\newline
In this context, the most relevant phenomena are organized as in the following table.

\chapter{Overall Description}
\section{Product Perspective}
We are going to analyze all the shared phenomena that are listed in the previous section. The concepts are clarified through class and state diagrams.\\ \vspace{2mm}

\noindent\textbf{Registration/Login} (World controlled, Machine observed)\\
A Guest can sign up to the application or log in, if already registered. 
In the case of a new submit, the System provides a form which the Guest have to fill with his data, specifying if he/she is 
a Citizien or an Authority.\\ \vspace{2mm}

\noindent\textbf{Commit of a report} (world controlled, machine observed)\\
A Citizen can send a Report with a description of the violation compiling a structured field. He/she has the possibility to  attach a picture. The System will check if the compiled fields are consistent and complete, then it will encrypt the Report and send it to the DBMS (Figure \ref{fig:State1}). \\ \vspace{2mm}

\noindent\textbf{Send Notification} (Machine controlled, World observed)\\
The System notifies the Authorities whenever a new Report is submitted by a Citizen. 
We assume that the notified Authorities will accordingly handle the violation reported. (Figure \ref{fig:State1}).
\begin{figure}[!ht]

\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{./img/Statechart_Report.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{SafeStreets' statechart diagram about the collection, notification, and storage of a Report.}
\label{fig:State1}
\end{figure} 
\newpage
\noindent\textbf{Build statistics} (Machine controlled, World observed)\\
The System analyzes the stored data and computes general statistics on the violations. In this way, the System is able to find unsafe areas and which vehicles commit the most violations. All Users can access general statistics, however only Authorities can request statistics on private information such as traffic tickets. If the System is allowed to access Municipality's data, statistics can be enhanced by crossing it with SafeStreets' information (Figure \ref{fig:State2}).  \\ \vspace{2mm}

\noindent\textbf{Safety suggestions} (Machine controlled, World observed)\\
The System gives Authorities suggestions for possible safe interventions. His knowledge is based on the statistics previously computed (Figure \ref{fig:State2}).

\end{figure}
\newpage
\subsection{Class Diagram}
The class diagram in Figure \ref{fig:UML} shows a possible representation of the Safe Streets' architecture. Notice that the Municipality's DBMS is only accessible by the System if SafeStreets is authorized by the AccessController. It's also important to outline that the System is not designed to provide a function to generate official traffic tickets, since only real world authorities (g.e. local police) can generate traffic tickets with legal validity.

\section{Product Functions}
In this section the most important features of the application are extensively explained:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Commit of a Report}: the System allows a Citizen to notify Authorities whenever a traffic violations occur. This function is achieved by compiling a Report with a picture of the violation, the date, time, position, and type of violation. Not all of these fields are always compulsory: for example, in the case the type of violation is \textit{accident}, only date, time and position are required. Once all the information is gathered and the report is sent to SafeStreets, the Report Manager goes in the \texttt{Verifying Information} status: it checks if all the obligatory fields have been compiled correctly, and then adds some useful metadata to the Report. Among the additional metadata, the systems takes note of whether or not the position has been provided by GPS, and also if the sender has added any license plate in the \texttt{Checking License Plate} status. If no license plate has been inserted, the Report Manager runs an OCR algorithm to retrive it from the picture provided (\texttt{Running OCR} status). \\
	After all the steps above, the Report is validated (\texttt{Validating Report} status) and a copy of it is notified to the Authorities, which we assume are going to handle it properly (g.e. dispatching a local police patrol). It is important to outline that the System is only designed to inform Authorities whenever a new report is confirmed, but by no means it provides a function which generates official traffic tickets or dispatches patrols in case of accidents. Also, it's relevant to notice that the Report Manager contains a list of all the Authorities, so it can notify all and only those Authorities who are on duty in the involved municipality. Finally, the Report is encrypted by means of a hash function (\texttt{Encrypting Report} status), thus no one can alter the information after its confirmation (see Section \ref{sec:security} for more details on security). \\
	Once the Report has been validated and encrypted the System is ready to store it: the Report is saved into a local buffer and there awaits to be exported into SafeStreets' database. Each day at a set time (g.e. between day/night shifts of the police) the System permanently stores all the Reports into the database. This mechanism takes advantages of the fact that one does not need fresh data to do general statistics, and in return it gives the possibility to schedule the Report storage when the System is not busy.

	\item \textbf{Build statistics}: the System analyzes the stored data to compute general statistics and returns useful information to the Users. This function is carried out by an Information Manager, which is in charge of retrieving, decrypting and elaborating the information stored by the Report Manager. In particular, the Information Manager periodically executes the following functions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Compute a statistic which highlights the areas and vehicles with the highest frequency of violations.
		\item \label{func2} Identify potentially unsafe areas by analyzing Reports of accidents, and suggest possible interventions.
		\item \label{func3} Analyze traffic ticket trends to build statistics about the most recurrent offenders and the effectiveness of SafeStreets.
	\end{enumerate}
	Every User can request to see the latest result of the functions above as soon as they are available. Since both Citizen and Authorities have access to those results, it's really important to give them different levels of visibility, so that classified information doesn't end up in the hands of civilians (g.e vehicles with the highest frequency of violations and most recurrent offenders). It is also worth noting that some of the above functions are enhanced, or even enabled, only if the Municipality grants the Information Manager access to their database. In particular, the Function \ref{func2} can be enhanced by crossing Authorities' accident information with SafeStreets', whereas Function \ref{func3} is entirely enabled only if the System has access to traffic tickets data.

	\item \textbf{Safety suggestions}: the System is able to give Authorities suggestions to improve the safety of urban areas. This function is enabled by the Information Manager and the statistics previously built. In fact, observing for each area which kind of violations are more frequent and the trends of the accidents, the Information Manager runs an artificial intelligence to detect which solution is the most suitable for a given problem. Just like for the report storing process, these suggestions are updated when the System is less busy (g.e. at night) and a sufficient amount of fresh data is added to the database. Safety suggestions are downloaded by SafeStreets' application togeter with the latest statistics results, whenever they are requested. Despite this, it should be noted that only Authorities have access to such data, as they are assumed to be those who implement the suggestions in order to improve their service.
\end{itemize}

\section{User Characteristics}
SafeStreets can be used from both Citizens and Authorities. It is recommended for adult users, but there are no limitation of age. 
We take for granted that the Users have access to Internet and are able to install and use the mobile application.\\
The character are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Guest}: anyone who downloads and opens the app but still has to sign
	up or log in. He/she cannot use any of the functions provided by SafeStreets.
	\item \textit{User}: a registered Guest who has to logged either as Citizen or as Authority. He/She is recognized by the System through an ID and can access any feature of the application granted for his/her role.
	\item \textit{Citizen}: someone who has logged-in with his credentials, which is recognized by the System through an ID. He/she can access to the personal data menu and add new reports.
	\item \textit{Authority}: someone who has logged-in with his credentials. He/she is notified every time a new Report regarding its municipality is stored by the System.
\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions, Dependencies and Constraints}
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item {[D.1]} The registration mail is assumed to be correctly recieved by the User.
	\item {[D.2]} The System internal clock time used to provide notifications is correct.
	\item {[D.3]} The Authorities notifications are assumed to be made only in case of parking violations. Indeed, if a little accident occurs there is no need to contact the Authorities. Instead if a dangerous accident happens it is better to call the Autorithies for a promptly intervention. The System uses accident report only to make statistics.
	\item {[D.4]} The Authorities are assumed to  take measures when they are notified about a new report.
	\item {[D.5]} After the first time, the System does not need to request the access to the Municipality's’ DBMS as long as the permission is still valid.
	\item {[D.6]} The statistics and suggestions are assumed to be consulted by Authorities periodically, in order to provide a better service.
	\item {[D.7]} Only specific component of the System is able to decrypt sensible data.
	\item {[D.8]} SafeStreets is not responsible of the traffic tickets generated by Authorities.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item DBMS needed in order to store and retrieve Users’ Reports.
	\item Information on issued tickets are provided by the Authorities' DBMS, which has limited access. 
	\item The OCR tool is provided by external thrid party services.
	\item The Map service is provided by external an third party (which can be different by the one that provides the OCR) tool.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Constraints} \label{constraints}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Smartphone equipped with an OS compatible with the application.
	\item Working Internet connection.
	\item The permission to acquire and store personal data must be given from the User. 
	\item Offer the possibility to the Users to delete their personal account.
	\item Provides statistics on issued tickets but it is impossible to know if the tickets are generated thanks to the service, or if they are independent from Safestreets.
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Performance Requirements}
SafeStreets is an application who's main job is to compute statistics and show the results to its Users. The collection of the data and the computation of the statistics are operations carried out by two distinct modules (respectively the Report Manager and the Information Manager) which write and read the database independently and asynchronously. This design is thought to benefit the performances: in conditions of high traffic the Report Manager can store the recieved Reports into a buffer and export later into secondary memory, whereas the Information Manager can suspend the computation of statistics and present to the requesting Users older results previously computed.
\section{Design Constraint}
As already mentioned in Section \ref{constraints}, since the System is not designed to provide a function to generate official traffic tickets, we can only assume that the Authorities will handle the reported traffic violations properly. For this reason, the System is not aware of whether or not the violation is being handled, at least as long as a corresponding traffic ticket is generated by an Authority (and the System has the authorization to access such data). However, the System cannot distinguish a traffic ticket generated with the help of SafeStreets by one that is not.
\\
Moreover, the System is not designed to communicate with any registry office, thus every user is identified by their username, mail and associated ID. This limitation is one of the reasons for which the System does not notify authorities when an accident is notified: in fact, small accidents are not technically traffic violations and often there's no need to call Authorities, whereas in case of serious accidents the Citizen is encouraged to call the police by phone call. In the latter case, the local police will collect the Citizen's testimony and generalities (which are not available in SafeStreets' user profiles) and hopefully will intervene as soon as possible. 
\subsection{Standards Compliance}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{GDPR} with regard to the processing of the User's personal data.
	\item \textbf{Latitude and Longidute degrees} for all the information regarding locations.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Hardware Limitations}
The application should be able to run, at least, under the following condi-
tions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item iOS or Android smartphone
	\item 3G connections at 2Mb/s
	\item 50 MB of space
	\item 2 GB of RAM
	\item GPS
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\section{Software System Attributes}
This section will cover the non-functional requirements that might be used to evaluate the software performances. All of the covered requirements are part of the ISO/IEC 9126-1:2001 (see Section \ref{docs}).
\subsection{Reliability}
The System (and all its components) should guarantees a 99\% of reliability. In order to guarantee the continuity of the service, it must be ensured that the System is fault tolerant.
\subsection{Availability}
The System must guarantee an high availability, indeed it has to offer a continuous service 24/7. 
\subsection{Security} \label{sec:security}
User credentials and data will be stored in a DBMS that should guarantee an high level of security. To reach this goal the passwords stored in the DBMS are salted and hashed, in this way a sequence of generic characters of any length is concatenated to the password, hashed it all and stored in the DBMS.
Hash is used also to stored the report so that the informations cannot be altered by anyone. So as soon as a report arrives to the Report Manager, the hash of the report is computed, encrypted to form a digital signature and then it is stored. In this way we create a snapshot of the report ensuring the identity, authenticity and non-tampered state of the informations.
As mentioned before, the System uses HTTP over SSL protocol (HTTPS) to comunicate with all the services in order to guarantee privacy and protection of the exchanged informations.
\newline
If someone break into the OCR tool or the Map service, the System is not responsible in case of damage, due to the fact that its functionalities are provided by third-part services.  
\subsection{Maintainability}
The System will have a modular architecture: Report Manager, Login Manager and Information Manager are designed to work separately in an asynchronous way, thus the maintenance process will be sped up in case of failure of one module.
\subsection{Portability}
SafeStreets is developed in terms of a native application on Android and iOS.
