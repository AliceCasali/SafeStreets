\chapter{Introduction}
This document represents the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) for SafeStreets: an application that aims to improve the safety of urban areas by giving its users the possibility to report parking violations and accidents to authorities. The goal of this document is to supply a description of the system in terms of its functional and non functional requirements, listing all of its goals, discussing the constraints and the limits of the software, and indicating the typical use cases that will occur after the release. This document is addressed to the stakeholders, who will evaluate the correctness of the assumptions and decisions contained in it, and to the developers who will have to implement the requirements.
\section{Purpose}
SafeStreets is a crowd-sourced application that intends to provide users with the possibility to notify authorities when traffic violations and accidents occur. In order to report a traffic violation, users have to compile a report containing a picture of the violation, the date, time, position, and type of violation. SafeStreets stores all the information provided by users, completing it with suitable metadata (timestamps, sender's GPS if available, etc.). In particular, in case the user had not provided any information regarding the license plate of the car breaking the traffic rules, SafeStreets runs an algorithm to read it from the submitted picture. Moreover, the application allows both end-users and authorities to mine the information that has been received: this function allows users to perform useful statistics, for example to find out which area is more dangerous or which vehicles commit the most violations. If the municipality offers a service that allows users to retrieve the information about the accidents that occur in its territory, SafeStreets can cross this information with its own data to identify potentially unsafe areas, and suggest possible interventions.
In addition, the municipality could offer a service that takes the information about the violations coming from SafeStreets, and generates traffic tickets from it. In this case, SafeStreets ensures that the chain of custody of information coming from users is never broken, thus information is never altered. Information about issued tickets can be used by SafeStreets to build statistics, for example to have a feedback on the effectiveness of the application.

\section{Scope}
% Stuff on world and shared phenomena
According to the \textit{World} and \textit{Machine} paradigm, proposed by M. Jackson and P. Zave in 1995, we can distinguish the \textit{Machine}, that is the portion of the system to be developed, from the \textit{World}, that is the portion of the real-world affected by the machine. In this way, we can classify the phenomena in three different types: World, Machine and \textit{Shared} phenomena, where the latter type of phenomena can be controlled by the world and observed by the machine or controlled by the machine and observed by the world.
\newline
In this context, the most relevant phenomena are organized as in the following table.
\begin{table}[!ht]
		%{pix.acc.} & {mean.acc.} & {mean.IoU} & {f.w.IoU}

\chapter{Overall Description}
\section{Product Perspective}
We are going to analyze all the shared phenomena that are listed in the previous section. The concepts are clarified throw class and state diagrams.\\
\\
\textbf{Registration/Login} (world controlled, machine observed)\\
A Guest can sign up to the application or log in, if already registered. 
In the case of a new submit, the System provides a form which the User have to fill with his data, specifying if he/she is 
a Citizien or an Authority. Then the data are collected in the associated DBMS.\\
\\ 
\textbf{Commit of a report} (world controlled, machine observed)\\
A Citizen can send a report with a description of the violation compiling a structured field. He/she has the possibility to  attach a picture. The System will check if the compiled fields are consistent and complete, then it will encrypt and send the Report to the DBMS (Figure \ref{fig:State1}). \\
\\
\textbf{Send Notification} (Machine controlled, World observed)\\
The System notifies the Authorities whenever a report is submitted by a Citizen. 
We assume that the notified Authorities will accordingly handle the violation reported. (Figure \ref{fig:State1}).
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{./img/img_Report.jpg}
\end{center}
\caption{SafeStreets' statehart diagram about the collection, notification, and storage of a Report.}
\label{fig:State1}
\end{figure} 
\newpage
\noindent \textbf{Build statistics} (Machine controlled, World observed)\\
The System analyzes the stored data and computes general statistics on the violations. In this way, the System is able to find unsafe areas and which vehicles commit the most violations. All Users can access general statistics, however only Authorities can request statistics on private information such as traffic tickets. If the System is allowed to access municipality's data, statistics can be enhanced by crossing it with SafeStreets' information (Figure \ref{fig:State2}).  \\
\\
\textbf{Safety suggestions} (Machine controlled, World observed)\\
The System gives Authorities suggestions for possible safe interventions. His knowledge is based on the statistics previously computed (Figure \ref{fig:State2}).\\

\end{center}
\caption{SafeStreets' statechart diagram of the creation of statistics on unsafe areas.}
\label{fig:State2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Class Diagram}
%Something later
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{./img/SWE1.png}
\end{center}
\caption{SafeStreets' class diagram.}
\label{fig:UML}
\end{figure} 
\noindent The class diagram in Figure \ref{fig:UML} shows a possible rapresentation of the SafeStreets' architecture. Notice that the Municipality package is only accessible by the System if SafeStreets is authorized to access such data. From the diagram above we can immediatly spot one of the limitations of SafeStreets: since the System is not designed to provide a function to generate official traffic tickets, we can only assume that the Authorities will handle the reported traffic violations properly. For this reason, the System is not aware of whether or not the violation is being handled, at least as long as a corresponding traffic ticket is generated by an Authority (and the System has the authorization to access such data).

\section{Product Functions}
In this section the most important features of the application are extensively explained:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Commit of a Report}: the System allows a Citizen to notify Authorities whenever a traffic violations and accidents occur. This function is achieved by compiling a Report with a picture of the violation, the date, time, position, and type of violation. Not all of these fields are always compulsory: in case the type of violation is \textit{accident}, only date, time and position are required. Once all the information is gathered and the report is sent to SafeStreets, the Report Manager goes in the \texttt{Verify Information} status: it checks if all the obligatory fields have been compiled correctly, and then adds some useful metadata to the Report. Among the additional metadata, the systems takes note of whether or not the position has been provided by GPS, and also if the sender has added any license plate. If no license plate has been inserted, the Report Manager runs an OCR algorithm to retrive it from the picture provided. Finally, the Report is encrypted by means of a hash function, thus no one can alter the information after its confirmation (see Section \ref{sec:security} for more details on security).\\
	After all the steps above, the Report is confirmed (\texttt{Repor Confirmed} status) and it is notified to the Authorities, which we assume are going to handle it properly (g.e. dispatching a local police patrol). It is important to outline that the System is only designed to inform Authorities whenever a new report is confirmed, but by no means it provides a function which generates official traffic tickets or dispatches patrols in case of accidents. Also, it's relevant to notice that the Report Manager contains a list of all the Authorities, so it can notify all and only those Authorities who are on duty in the involved municipality. \\
	Once the report has been confimed and notified, the System enters the status \texttt{Ready to Store}: the Report is exported into the database, where it can be retrieved and dectypted only by the Information Manager.

	\item \textbf{Build statistics}: the System analyzes the stored data to compute general statistics and returns useful information to the Users. This function is carried out by an Information Manager, which is in charge of retrieving, decrypting and elaborating the information stored by the Report Manager. In particular, the Information Manager periodically executes the following functions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Compute a statistic which highlights the areas and vehicles with the highest frequency of violations.
		\item \label{func2} Identify potentially unsafe areas by analyzing Reports of accidents, and suggest possible interventions.
		\item \label{func3} Analyze traffic ticket trends to build statistics about the most recurrent offenders or the effectiveness of SafeStreets.
	\end{enumerate}
	Every User can request to see the latest result of the functions above as soon as they are available. Since both Citizen and Authorities have access to those results, it's really important to give them different levels of visibility, so that classified information doesn't end up in the hands of civilians (g.e vehicles with the highest frequency of violations and most recurrent offenders). It is also worth noting that some of the above functions are enhanced, or even enabled, only if the municipalities grant the System access to their database. In particular, the Function \ref{func2} can be enhanced by crossing Authorities' accident information with Safestreets', whereas Function \ref{func3} is entirely enabled only if the System has access to traffic tickets data.

\end{itemize}

\section{User Characteristics}
SafeStreets can be used from both Citizens and Authorities. It is recommended for adult user but there are not limitation of age. 
We give for granted that the Users have access to Internet and are able to install anduse the mobile application.\\
The character are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Guest}:someone who downloads and opens the app but still has to sign
	up. He/she cannot use any of the functions provided by SafeStreets.
	\item \textit{User}: a registered Guest who has to log-in in order to access any feature of the application. He/she can retrieve his/her personal data from any
	device with the app installed just providing credentials.
	\item \textit{Citizen}: a person who logged-in with his credentials, which is recognized by the System through an ID. He/she can access to the personal data menu and add new reports.
	\item \textit{Authority}: a person who logged-in with his credentials. He/she can access to all the Report that has been notified for the municipality of belonging.
\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions, Dependencies and Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
	\item {[D.1]} The given email is assumed to be correct.
	\item {[D.2]} The sent email is assumed to be correctly received.
	\item {[D.3]} The System internal clock time used to provide notifications is
	correct.
	\item {[D.4]} The badge number of the Authority is assumed to be correct.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The System needs a DBMS in order to store and retrieve Users’ report.
	\item Information on issued ticket are provided by the Authorities' DBMS, if they give the System free access.
	\item OCR tool is provided by external thrid party services.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Users must have a smartphone equipped with an OS compatible with the application.
	\item Users must have Internet connection.
	\item The System must ask Users for the permission to acquire and store personal data. Therefore, the System must offer 
	the possibility to the Users to delete their personal account.
	\item The System provides statistics on issued tickets but it can not know if the tickets come from its pull of report, or if they are independent from its services.
\end{itemize}

\section{Software System Attribute}
\subsection{Reliability}
The System (and all its components) should guarantees a 99\% of reliability.
\subsection{Availability}
The System must guarantee an high availability, indeed it has to offer a continuous service 24 hours every day. 
\subsection{Security} \label{sec:security}
User credentials and data will be stored in a DBMS that should guarantee an high level of security. To reach this goal the passwords stored in the DBMS are salted and hashed, in this way a sequence of generic characters of any length is concatenated to the password, hashed it all and stored in the DBMS.
Hash is used also to stored the report so that the informations cannot be altered by anyone. So as soon as a report arrives to the Report Manager, the hash of the report is computed, encrypted to form a digital signature and then it is stored. In this way we create a snapshot of the report ensuring the identity, authenticity and non-tampered state of the informations.
As mentioned before, the System uses HTTP over SSL protocol (HTTPS) to comunicate with all the services in order to guarantee privacy and protection of the exchanged informations.
\newline
If someone break into the OCR service, the System is not responsible in case of damage, due to the fact that its functionalities are provided by third-part services.  
\subsection{Maintainability}
\subsection{Portability}
