\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
This document represents the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) for SafeStreets: a crowd-sourced application that intends to provide users with the possibility to notify authorities when traffic violations and accidents occur. Our purpose is to supply a description of the system in terms of its functional and non functional requirements, listing all of its goals, discussing the constraints and the limits of the software, and indicating the typical use cases that will occur after the release. This document is addressed to the stakeholders, who will evaluate the correctness of the assumptions and decisions contained in it, and to the developers who will have to implement the requirements.
\subsection{Description of the given problem}
SafeStreets aims to improve the safety of urban areas by giving its users the possibility to report traffic violations and accidents to authorities. To achieve both these functionalities, the system will manage them separately. In order to report a traffic violation, the application should allow users to send pictures of violations, including their date, time, and position. blablabla
\subsection{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {[G.1]} The System allows the Users to access the functionalities of the application from different locations and devices.
    \item {[G.2]} The System allows the Users to authenticate themselves either as Authority or Citizen.
    \item {[G.3]} The System allows the Citizens to document traffic violations to Authorities by compiling a Report.
    \item {[G.4]} The Report Manager handles the submissions:
    \indent \item {[G.4.1]} Before accepting any Report, the Report Manager ensures that it contains a picture of the violation, the date, time, position, and type of violation.
    \indent \item {[G.4.2]} The Report Manager notifies all logged in Authorities whenever a new Report is accepted.
    \indent \item {[G.4.3]} The Report Manager must ensure that no more than one Authority has taken in charge the same Report.
    \indent \item {[G.4.4]} The Report Manager notifies Citizens whenever one of their Reports has been taken in charge by an Authority.
    \item {[G.5]} The System stores the reports provided by the Citizens.
    \indent \item  {[G.5.1]} If the Citizen has not provided any information about the license plate, the System runs an algorithm to read it from the submitted picture.
