\chapter{Introduction}
This document represents the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) for SafeStreets: an application that aims to improve the safety of urban areas by giving its users the possibility to report parking violations and accidents to authorities. The goal of this document is to supply a description of the system in terms of its functional and non functional requirements, listing all of its goals, discussing the constraints and the limits of the software, and indicating the typical use cases that will occur after the release. This document is addressed to the stakeholders, who will evaluate the correctness of the assumptions and decisions contained in it, and to the developers who will have to implement the requirements.
\section{Purpose}
SafeStreets is a crowd-sourced application that intends to provide users with the possibility to notify authorities when traffic violations and accidents occur. In order to report a traffic violation, users have to compile a report containing a picture of the violation, the date, time, position, and type of violation. SafeStreets stores all the information provided by users, completing it with suitable metadata (timestamps, sender's GPS if available, etc.). In particular, in case the user had not provided any information regarding the license plate of the car breaking the traffic rules, SafeStreets runs an algorithm to read it from the submitted picture. Moreover, the application allows both end-users and authorities to mine the information that has been received: this function allows users to perform useful statistics, for example to find out which area is more dangerous or which vehicles commit the most violations. If the municipality offers a service that allows users to retrieve the information about the accidents that occur in its territory, SafeStreets can cross this information with its own data to identify potentially unsafe areas, and suggest possible interventions.
In addition, the municipality could offer a service that takes the information about the violations coming from SafeStreets, and generates traffic tickets from it. In this case, SafeStreets ensures that the chain of custody of information coming from users is never broken, thus information is never altered. Information about issued tickets can be used by SafeStreets to build statistics, for example to have a feedback on the effectiveness of the application.

\section{Scope}
% Stuff on world and shared phenomena
According to the \textit{World} and \textit{Machine} paradigm, proposed by M. Jackson and P. Zave in 1995, we can distinguish the \textit{Machine}, that is the portion of the system to be developed, from the \textit{World}, that is the portion of the real-world affected by the machine. In this way, we can classify the phenomena in three different types: World, Machine and \textit{Shared} phenomena, where the latter type of phenomena can be controlled by the world and observed by the machine or controlled by the machine and observed by the world.
\newline
In this context, the most relevant phenomena are organized as in the following table.
\begin{table}[!ht]
		%{pix.acc.} & {mean.acc.} & {mean.IoU} & {f.w.IoU}

\chapter{Overall Description}
\section{Product Perspective}
We are going to analyze all the shared phenomena that are listed in the previous section. The concepts are clarified throw class and state diagrams.\\
\\
\textbf{Registration/Login} (world controlled, machine observed)\\
A User can sign up to the application or log in, if is already registered. 
In the case of a new submit, the System provides a form which the User have to fill with his data, specifying if he/she is 
a Citizien or an Authority. Then the data are collected in the associated DBMS.\\
\\
\textbf{Commit of a report} (world controlled, machine observed)\\
A User can send a report with a description of the violation compiling a structured field. He/she has the possibility to  attach a picture. The System will check if the information inserted in the fields are consistent and complete, then will send them to the
DBMS.\\
\\
\textbf{Build statistics} (machine controlled, world observed)\\
The System computes general statistics on the violations, and also finds unsafe areas. These general information can be seen by the Citizens. Other specific statistics are accessible only by Authorities an example is
the vehicles which commits multiple infractions, and also to see how the trends of issued tickets change. \\
\\
\textbf{Safety suggestions} (machine controlled, world observed)\\
The System gives suggestions for possible safe interventions. His knowledge is based on data statistics.\\
\\
%\textbf{Generation of traffic tickets} (machine controlled, world observed)\\
%The Authorities can compile a legal form to make a traffic ticket, using the information about traffic violation. 
%The System provides security tools to protect sensible data.\\
%\\
\textbf{Send Notification} (machine controlled, world observed)\\
The System notifies a logged Authority when a report is submitted by an User. 
Then the Authority takes the right legal measure based on the information that he/she gets.

\section{Product Functions}
In this section the most important features of the application are extensively explained:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Commit of a Report}: the System allows a Citizen to notify Authorities whenever a traffic violations and accidents occur. This function is achieved by compiling a Report with a picture of the violation, the date, time, position, and type of violation. Not all of these fields are always compulsory: in case the type of violation is \textit{accident}, only date, time and position are required. Once all the information is gathered and the report is sent to SafeStreets, the Report Manager goes into the \texttt{Verify Information} status: it checks if all the obligatory fields have been compiled correctly, and then adds some useful metadata to the Report. Among the additional metadata, the systems takes note of whether or not the position has been provided by GPS, and also if the sender has added any license plate. If no license plate has been inserted, the Report Manager runs an OCR algorithm to retrive it from the picture provided. \\
	After all the steps above, the Report is confirmed (\texttt{Repor Confirmed} status) and it is notified to the Authorities, which we assume are going to handle it properly (g.e. dispatching a local police patrol). It is important to outline that the System is only designed to inform Authorities whenever a new report is confirmed, but by no means it provides a function which generates official traffic tickets or dispatches patrols in case of accidents. Also, it's relevant to notice that the Report Manager contains a list of all the Authorities, so it can notify all and only those Authorities who are on duty in the involved municipality. \\
	Once the report has been confimed and notified, the System enters the status \texttt{Ready to Store}: the report is saved into a local buffer and there awaits to be exported into SafeStreets' database. Each day at a set time (g.e. between day/night shifts of the police) the System permanently stores all the Reports into the database. This mechanism takes advantages of the fact that one does not need fresh data to do general statistics, and in return it gives the possibility to schedule the report storage when the System is not busy.

	\item \textbf{Build statistics}: the System analyzes the stored data to compute general statistics and returns useful information to the Users. This function is carried out by an Information Manager, which is in charge of gathering the needed information from the storage an elaborating it. In particular, the Information Manager periodically executes the following functions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Compute a statistic which highlights the areas and vehicles with the highest frequency of violations.
		\item Identify potentially unsafe areas by analyzing Reports of accidents, and suggest possible interventions.
		\item Analyze traffic ticket trends to build statistics about the most recurrent offenders or the effectiveness of SafeStreets.
	\end{enumerate}
	Every User can request to see the latest result of the functions above as soon as they are available. Since both Citizen and Authorities have access to those results, it's really important to give them different levels of visibility, so that classified information doesn't end up in the hands of civilians (g.e vehicles with the highest frequency of violations and most recurrent offenders). It is also worth noting that some of the above functions are enhanced, or even enabled, only if the municipalities grant the System access to their database. In particular, function 2 can be enhanced by crossing Authorities' accident information with Safestreets', whereas function 3 is entirely enabled only if the System has access to traffic tickets data.

\end{itemize}
\newpage
\section{User Characteristics}
SafeStreets can be used from both Citizens and Authorities. It is recommended for adult user but there are not limitation of age. 
We give for granted that the Users have access to Internet and are able to install anduse the mobile application.\\
The character are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Guest}:someone who downloads and opens the app but still has to sign
	up. He/she cannot use any of the functions provided by SafeStreets.
	\item \textit{User}: a registered Guest who has to log-in in order to access any feature of the application. He/she can retrieve his/her personal data from any
	device with the app installed just providing credentials.
	\item \textit{Citizen}: a person who logged-in with his credentials, which is recognized by the System through an ID. He/she can access to the personal data menu and add new reports.
	\item \textit{Authority}: a person who logged-in with his credentials. He/she can access to all the Report that has been notified for the municipality of belonging.
\end{itemize}
