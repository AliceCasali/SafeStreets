\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
This document represents the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) for SafeStreets: a crowd-sourced application that intends to provide users with the possibility to notify authorities when parking violations and accidents occur. Our purpose is to supply a description of the system in terms of its functional and non functional requirements, listing all of its goals, discussing the constraints and the limits of the software, and indicating the typical use cases that will occur after the release. This document is addressed to the stakeholders, who will evaluate the correctness of the assumptions and decisions contained in it, and to the developers who will have to implement the requirements.
\section{Scope}
\subsection{Description of the given problem}
SafeStreets aims to improve the safety of urban areas by giving its users the possibility to report parking violations and accidents to authorities. To achieve both these functionalities, the system will manage them separately. In order to report a parking violation, the application should allow users to send (A CHI? A UN DB? ALLA PULA DIRETTAMENTE?) pictures of violations, including their date, time, and position.
