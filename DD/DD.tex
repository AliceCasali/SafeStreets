\chapter{Introduction}
While the RASD presented a general view of the SafeStreets appliction and its features, this document aims to further analyze the system's design and architecture, by describing for each of its components their runtime behaviour, integration, interfaces, implementation and testing plans.
This document is mainly intended to be used by the test and development teams as a guidance in the development process, but also to prevent structural degradation during maintainance and extension phases. Nonetheless, the document is also addressed to all the stakeholders who are interested in supervising the development process.
