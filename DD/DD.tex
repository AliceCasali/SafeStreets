\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
While the RASD presented a general view of the SafeStreets appliction and its features, this document aims to further analyze the system's design and architecture, as well as describing for each of its components their runtime behaviour, integration, interfaces, implementation and testing plans.
This document is mainly intended to be used by the test and development teams as a guidance in the development process, but also to prevent structural degradation during maintainance and extension phases. Nonetheless, the document is also addressed to all the stakeholders who are interested in supervising the development process.

\section{Scope}
SafeStreets: an application that aims to improve the safety of urban areas by giving its users the possibility to report traffic violations to authorities. Users are logged in either as citizen, those who report the violations, and authorities, those who are notified about newly reported violations and are supposed to take action on them.\\
The system is in charge of collecting all the Reports, storing them, and notifying the authorities about them. The stored Reports are then used to build statistics, find unsafe areas, and compute suggestions on how to improve the safety of such areas. The system may also communicate with local Municipalities' Systems in order to retrieve information about accidents and iussued traffic ticket: in this case some of the above functions are enhanced, and some new functions are enabled (g.e computing statistics on traffic ticked).\\
\newline
Further information about the scope of the application can be found in the Chapter 1 of the RASD.

\section{Overview}
In this chapter the architectural structure of the system will be discussed at multiple levels of abstraction. A high-level view of the components and their interactions is represented in Figure \ref{fig:overview}. The details will be explained in the next sections.

\section{Selected architectural	styles and patterns}
The following architectural patterns are used to build the structure of the system in order to provide all the services of SafeStreets application.\\

\begin{center}\large{\textbf{Client-Server Architecture}}\end{center}
Client-Server architecture is a computing model that features two roles: a Server that hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services, and a Client which exploits them.
\begin{center}\large{\textit{Motivations}}\end{center}
\noindent This structure provides several advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scalability and Mantainability: it is possible to repair or add more resources to the architecture without significative service interruptions.
    \item Security: the server is able to manage what levels of access each user can have with respect to specific resources.
\end{itemize}\vspace{2mm}

\begin{center}\large{\textbf{Three-tiered Architecture}}\end{center}
This type of architecture is a kind of Client-Server paradigm where three tiers are phisically separated:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textit{presentation tier} is the top-most level of the architecture, which provides an interface that users can use to directly access the application. 
	It is the top-most tier and the only one accessible from the Client.
	\item The \textit{application tier} runs the business logic of the application and executes functions that elaborate data. 
	A Reverse Proxy is needed to handle the Client requests and to balance the workload, the requests are forwarded to 
	the application serves in order to provide the right data.
	\item The \textit{database tier} includes the data persistence mechanisms and the data access layer that encapsulates 
	the persistence mechanisms and exposes the data.
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}\large{\textit{Motivations}}\end{center}
A multi-tier application architecture provides a model with several advantages: in this way developers can create flexible and reusable 
applications that can be modified, enhanced or maintained just by operating on a specific layer, instead of reworking the entire application. Furthermore, a general multitier architecture can also help improve the development efficiency by allowing teams to focus on their core competencies.

	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/TiersArchitecture.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Three-tier architecture schema.}
\end{figure}

\begin{center}\large{\textbf{Thin Client}}\end{center}
A thin Client is a lightweight computer which does most of the computation in a remote Server. In this paradigm in fact, since the Servers take care of several duties such as storage 
of data and performing calculations, the Client does not need to have a large memory or powerful computing capabilities to run the application.
\begin{center}\large{\textit{Motivations}}\end{center} 
The application is thought for mobile phones which do not have great computing power or very large memories. Thanks to a thin client a internet connection is virtually the only requirements to use the application. Furthermore, this architecture simplify the front-end implementation by shifting most of the execution to the servers.

\begin{center}\large{\textbf{MVC Design Pattern}}\end{center}
Model-View-Controller is a software design pattern commonly used to develop user interfaces. Indeed, this pattern is used for the front-end implementation of the application. It divides the program logic in three interconnected elements: \textit{model} that directly manages data and rules of the application, \textit{view} which handles any representation of data, \textit{controller} that 
accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view. This mechanism is used to separate internal representation of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. \\
\begin{center}\large{\textit{Motivations}}\end{center} 
MVC allows full encapsulation of objects. This means that each component can be changed without creating issues to other components.
Furthermore, MVC provides decopuling of its components, which means that developers are able to work in parallel on different components of the pattern without interfering with each other.

\begin{center}\large{\textbf{Reverse Proxy Design Pattern}}\end{center}
A simple proxy acts as an interface to refer an object in another machine. The reverse proxy offers a single point of access (with HTTP) to multiple Clients who want to access to several application servers. In practice, it is a wrapper for an object behind the scenes. 
Proxies also provides extra functionalities such as data caching (g.e. store the newest statistics available) and security (g.e. client-side firewall).\\
\begin{center}\large{\textit{Motivations}}\end{center} 
It is useful to organize the requests of multiple clients and to save frequent requested informations. It also protects the application servers from external attack and slightly improve the overall performances.
