\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
While the RASD presented a general view of the SafeStreets appliction and its features, this document aims to further analyze the system's design and architecture, by describing for each of its components their runtime behaviour, integration, interfaces, implementation and testing plans.
This document is mainly intended to be used by the test and development teams as a guidance in the development process, but also to prevent structural degradation during maintainance and extension phases. Nonetheless, the document is also addressed to all the stakeholders who are interested in supervising the development process.

\section{Scope}
SafeStreets: an application that aims to improve the safety of urban areas by giving its Users the possibility to report traffic violations to Authorities. Users are logged in either as Citizen, those who report the violations, and Authorities, those who are notified about newly reported violations and are supposed to take action on them.\\
The system is in charge of collecting all the Reports, storing them, and notifying the Authorities about them. The stored Reports are then used to build statistics, find unsafe areas, and compute suggestions on how to improve the safety of such areas. The system can also communicate local Municipalities' Systems in order to retrieve information about accidents and iussued traffic ticket: in this case some of the above functions are enhanced, and some new functions are enabled (g.e computing statistics on traffic ticked).\\
\newline
Further information about the scope of the application can be found in the Chapter 1 of the RASD.

\chapter{Architectural Design}
\section{Overview}
In this chapter the architectural structure of the system will be discussed at multiple levels of abstraction. A high-level view of the components and their interactions is represented in Figure \ref{fig:overview}. The details will be explained in the next sections.

\section{Selected architectural	styles and patterns}
The following architectural patterns are used for defining the structure of the system:
\subsection{Client-Server Architecture}
In this structure there are two main roles with different duties, the client uses data and services offered by the server.
The server stores all data in order to provide them to the client.\\
\textbf{Motivations:} this pattern dues to several advantages. Server can be replicated to have more scalability. 
Accessibility: users can use the services without hte need for a specialized device or client.
The security is granted because the server allows only registered user to consult data.
Furthermore, it is easy to update, replace, repair, move a server without affecting clients.
\subsection{Three-tiered Architecture}
This type of architecture is a client-server architecture where three tiers are phisically separated.\\
The \textit{presentation tier} provide an interface to allow the user to consult data and result of services executed in a different layer. 
It is the top-most tier and the only one accessible from the client.\\
The \textit{application tier} executes the logic of the application throw functions that elaborate data. 
The reverse proxy is needed to handle the client requests and to balance the workload, the requests are forwarded to 
the application serves in order to provide the right data.\\
The \textit{database tier} includes the data persistence mechanisms and the data access layer that encapsulates 
the persistence mechanisms and exposes the data.
